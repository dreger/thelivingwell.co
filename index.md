# the living well

Im glad you're here. Why am I here? Good question. 

I think balancing life is hard. Eating well (or remembering to eat at all), staying active (or making it out of bed) and spending time with God (or...not) it becomes a lot to juggle amid the rest of our busy lives. But I believe I am free to be my best self when I pursue wellness in all areas of my life.

We have so many opinions, trends, and how-to's thrown at us on a daily basis. Its too much. I want to claim back our power to choose what is best for our own soul. 

Hate yoga? Good for you. Rather eat tree bark than try kale? Lean into that, sister. I want to bring back authenticity. My hope is, this space will motivate you to find your own healthy rhythms.

Wellness looks different on all of us, and that is a beautiful thing. It's a divine balance of determination and grace, of self-awareness and self-denial. It requires us to take inventory of our heart and be willing to sweep the caverns of our soul. It's being willing to ask hard questions and mustering up the courage to act on the answers. 

Wellness is not about _feeling well_ all the time. Infact, sometimes it feels a bit messy when we press into our most genuine selves. Being well is about leaning into the messy places of our heart and allowing God to do work.

_We pursue wellness, and God is the one who makes it so._

I write according to three general categories, because I like to be organized (and odd numbers make me happy)

**Be Well:** Spirituality and walking with Jesus - who is our living water from the living well. (get it?)

**Eat Well:** Food, food, food. Because, I love food and food is fuel.

**Live Well:** Practically living it out. What wellness looks like in my life from day-to-day.

This corner of the internet, much like my life, is a work in progress. Sit with your messiness, and read about mine. It’ll make you feel like you’re not the only one who can't get it together, promise. 

**“Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water, welling up to eternal life” John 4:13-14**

Welcome to the living well.
