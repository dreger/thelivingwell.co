# about the living well

The Living Well was born out of a desire for all women to embrace holistic wellness - mind, body and spirit. I'm convinced we are free to be our best selves when we are pursuing wellness in all areas of our lives. Wellness is a divine balance of determination and grace. Of self-awareness and self-denial. It requires us to take inventory of our heart and be willing to sweep the caverns of our soul. It's being willing to ask ourselves hard questions and not be afraid to act on the answers. It's about (re)discovering giftings God created in you and operating from your most true self.

This journey is about absolute truth and absolute freedom in Jesus, who IS the living well. "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water, welling up to eternal life." John 4:13-14
