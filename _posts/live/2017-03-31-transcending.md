Everything about my life feels perfect. I’ve never had a season like this before. And I find myself feeling guilty. 

Certainly, it's not fair for my life to be this abundantly rich. No, not when there is so much suffering around me. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. I keep looking for the "but.."

The interesting thing is, my life is not perfect. I've been managing chronic back pain. I am an entire ocean away from friends and family. I am still navigating how to live with infertility. I have heavy things on my shoulders, yet the load feels anything but. 

I wasn't always this way. Infact, I used to wear suffering as a badge of honor. I’ve only recently learned how to [let go of past pain.](http://thelivingwell.co/be/let-go) I thought having some kind of pain or drama, was the unifier of all humanity. I believed if I wasn’t operating from pain, I wasn’t actually alive. **But the thing about pain is, you can be fully awake to it, without being led by it.** 

I want to spend the energy of my life being led by my spirit, not my wounds. Since my spirit is made for joy, joy is where I begin.

I recently stumbled upon a quote that stopped me dead in my tracks: _the grass is greener wherever you water it._

Boom. Joy grows when we take time to cultivate it. I've found a few rhythms that help me foster joy. 

**1 //** I keep a gratitude journal. I write down everything from the blue sky, to profound spiritual moments of clarity. I pen it all down in a notebook. Sometimes I can only think of two things, other days I write down 20. When I hit 1000, I start a new notebook. It takes me a year to get there, and it's usually right around Thanksgiving that I begin a new one. This rhythm allows me to practice receiving joy in every single thing.

**2 //** My mornings are sacred. This is easy for me, because I work from home. But I don't do anything until I've spent time in the word and on my mat. Carving out time to center myself, no matter what time of day, is key to staying grounded.

**3 //** Spirit walk. On my day off, I take a walk through the more park-like setting of our town. I get out in nature. My phone is on do not disturb, and I listen to a meditation podcast or worship music. I intentionally keep my mind present. I don’t run through my mental to-do list or rehash a conversation. It's my time to connect with Holy Spirit, through presence and nature.  

_When we fix our eyes on our creator instead of our circumstances, life gets good._

Now, I see the world with fresh expectancy every morning. The simplicity of flowers blooming, and the gift of steady breath, each thing becomes a love letter written just for me. My soul collects each one, keeping them tucked close to my heart. 

_And when the world around you looks like a letter of love, joy can abound._ 

My well of joy runs deep and steady, regardless of present suffering. I transcend the pain, because I know in the marrow of my bones, it’s only temporary. I transcend pain, not because I have silenced it. I transcend it, because I have sat with it, listened to it, and allowed myself to grow from it. 

_Pain is the seed of the tree, not the leaves that grow._

transcend well,
