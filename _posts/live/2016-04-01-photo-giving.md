We aren’t professionals. He’s a chemist, I’m a creative and [photography]( https://www.flickr.com/photos/135284560@N02/albums) is where our worlds collide. 

Somewhere along the way, our shared hobby turned into a way to bless others. Our final product isn’t what you’d pay big bucks for - the professionals do unbelievable work and we honor their skills.

What we do is smaller scale, with specific focus: giving photos to those who couldn’t otherwise afford it. Single moms, young engaged couples – we know money is tight, but memories are still precious. 

Photographing friends and family became a way to give ourselves freely to others.  So that’s what we do, we give our time. We follow your family around and capture your authentic lives, for free. 

We don’t have a studio. We don’t show up with props or a crazy entourage. Just us, sometimes only me, and the camera.
You be you, and I just shoot. 

And on the other side of the camera, I pray for you. For your marriage, your sweet babe or whatever God prompts.  For an hour or so, I get to bear witness to unique lives. And while giving photos is a gift to you, the whole thing is a gift to me.

_From one of our repeat shoots: “From what I understand from my friends, family photo sessions can be a stressful event. I am fortunate enough to have never experienced that in the year and a half since we became a family of three. None of our photos seem staged, and we're never in awkward poses. That's because they let us just BE. We act like ourselves, we move like ourselves, and they capture our uniqueness in each photograph. What starts as a toddler running away from the photoshoot turns into a picture that perfectly encapsulates our daughter's love of movement and freedom. Something that wasn't planned turned into the photo we chose for our Christmas card. We have so much fun whenever we connect with them, and are always blown away with the stunning photos we have that capture our family's essence. These two have such beautiful souls and it is evident that this is a true passion of theirs and a gift they desire to share with others.”_
