I recently started reading [The gifts of Imperfection.](http://www.amazon.com/The-Gifts-Imperfection-Supposed-Embrace/dp/159285849X)
Rocking my perfectionist world over here.

I am painfully aware of the ways perfectionism hinders me from experiencing the freedom God has for my life. I’ve been hell-bent on trying to rewire the default setting in me that has to be perfect all. the.time. Part of me assumed once I identified it and asked God to kill it, that it would up and walk out of my life and I’d wave “see ya never!” 

Not so. 
I’ve named it, prayed over it, yelled at it, meditated the heck over and yet, I’m still very much a perfectionist.  

I’ve seen the ways it has robbed me of joy. I’ve counted the nights I have lost sleep over situations where I didn’t respond perfectly to someone. I sit stuck in fear of not living up to the expectations (real or imagined) people have of me. I know my perfectionist tendencies keep me on the sidelines.

And now I’m mad.

I don’t get mad about a lot of things in life. Hardly ever, really. But mad is the emotion that rears its head when I am plain sick and tired of sitting in my own junk. Get on with it, already!
*Madness is my catalyst.* And in my madness, I am determined to change.

Like any other habit in life, imperfection must be practiced.

Every week I am going to post a new way to practice imperfection. I’ll post the prompt on Sunday and we’ll spend the week practicing it.
Post about it, write about it, tell me how you’re [#practicingimperfection.](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/practicingimperfection/)

Galatians 3:3  is my slap in the face reminder that I am not called to be perfect, Jesus has that one on lock down. 
How foolish can you be? After starting your Christian lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort?

Boom. By the power of the spirit, may you practice imperfection and totally own it.
