Kicking off my #fearisnottheboss series with a dear friend, Christine. She and I know each other through friends that are more like family. So by extension, she's family too. She's a busy mama, workin on her dream job of being an interior designer. Follow her over at [Christine Mccall Home](https://christinemccallhome.com/) I mean come on, isn't that business name just dreamy??

"[Christine McCall Home](https://christinemccallhome.com/) was created to document the interior styling of our [new home](https://christinemccallhome.com/our-home/) and what inspires me along the way. I am a wife, mama, marketing creative, and resident homebody. I reside in Pittsburgh, PA with my husband Matt, son Ryder, and pups Lewie and Briggs. You’ll most likely find me chasing my toddler down Target aisles in black yoga leggings and a pair of kicks."

**As a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?**

_What I wanted to be when I grew up was always changing as a kid. One minute I wanted to be a pediatrician, the next a professional basketball player. In high school I wanted to be Andy Roddick’s wife and travel the world attending his grand slam tennis matches. Sadly, that never happened._

**What did you used to do? (Career path/hobby wise)**

_In college I studied Sport Business Management and Marketing, with the hope of working in Community Relations for a professional sport organization. The economic downturn hit right as I graduated (May, 2008) and there were zero jobs within that field. Perfect timing, right? Thankfully, I also had a Marketing degree to fall back on and was lucky enough to secure a job within that space upon graduating. Nothing like jumping into the real world a mere two weeks after graduating college._

_My first job was as a Marketing Assistant for a professional canvas print company. I ran webinars, created newsletters, drafted website copy, wrote content for sales and marketing materials, planned and executed tradeshow booth displays, handled sponsorships and vendor relations, and much more. Eventually I became Marketing Coordinator and ran a marketing department with just myself, a VP of Marketing, and our CEO. The hours were long and I was a perfectionist. I also had to travel, which was exciting at first but soon grew old quickly. Work there was chaotic and stressful. I cried. ALOT. Looking back, however, it was one of the best learning experiences of my life. In those two years I became a professional and more importantly an adult. _

_After that, I spent almost four years as a Marketing Manager for a company that connects organizations with external innovation resources to accelerate innovation in private, public and social sectors. SAY WHAT? It’s still confusing to me too. Going to work for this company was my first experience collaborating with an entire marketing team and it was both emotionally and mentally fulfilling. My work and my time felt both appreciated and valued. I loved every single minute of my time there. In addition to the marketing duties listed above, I was also in charge of planning and executing leadership summits and managing the build and daily maintenance of our new company website. I’m sure you’ve all heard of a little thing called Coding? Well, I had to self teach myself how to code pretty quickly. In Marketing, you wear many hats. And that’s why I love it._

_Simultaneously, I was building a life with my new husband. We were living in our first home and expecting our first child. With no extended family close by, I made the decision to stay home with our new son and stopped working in May of 2014._

**When/why did you start pursuing what you're doing now?**

_For the next two years, my creative energy was stalled. My entire focus was on our little boy. And that was okay. I got to experience motherhood ALL IN and it was life-changing. During that time, we also made the move from Cleveland to Pittsburgh to be closer to family. Once settled into our new life, I still wasn’t really doing anything with my own. And my son had become a self-sufficient human - walking, talking, potty trained, etc. I decided it was time to do something for myself. Which is also okay. Can we all agree on HOW OKAY THIS REALLY IS??? So, I made the decision to channel my creativity energy within a new medium and immersed myself in decorating our new home._

_There’s something special about making your home feel like your home. From the fresh paint to the new furniture and home accents. The personal touches make you feel safe, comfortable and content. Needless to say, the walls of this home have left me inspired. My creative spirit reignited. So much so, in May of 2016, I created an Instagram feed to document the interior styling of our new home. I’ve since branched out on additional social media platforms, created a blog, took an interior design class, and am currently designing spaces for friends and family. Pinch me, now._

**How do you cope when comparison creeps in?**

_There’s a quote I came across recently through [TheEveryGirl.com](TheEveryGirl.com) that has really resonated with me in regards to this topic._

## “Don’t compare your beginning to someone else’s middle.” ##
-Erica Gellerman, Small Business Consultant. 

_I feel like I recite this message to myself on a daily basis. With the rise of social media, our work and the work of others has become so accessible. It’s both a blessing and a curse. My head often becomes so crowded with beautiful design work, I find myself doubting what I know and overwhelmed with how much more I have to learn. It’s at this point that I disconnect, take a deep breath, and remind myself where I am in my individual journey._

**What motivates you to keep going, when others doubt/don't approve or understand your passion?**

_I consider myself extremely lucky to have always been surrounded by people in my life who have wanted to see me happy. Quick story. The other day I was approached to work with a real client and I kindly declined. The reason being that I’m not ready to make that kind of jump just yet. My mother texted me shortly thereafter encouraging me to take the job, that I could do it, to ‘not say I can’t, but I can.’ Amazing. What more motivation could I ask for?_  

**What are you most afraid of?**

_Full disclosure. I’m afraid of not being able to do it. Of not being able to walk into a strangers home and bring their vision to life. I’m afraid of failing them because well, what do I know? Let’s get real. I’m a stay-at-home mom with eight years of marketing experience and hardly any interior design training. It’s scary. But you know what’s more scary? Choosing not to do something that I love to do. Will I become resentful? Will I become unhappy? Will I become someone who sits on the sidelines of actually living their life?_ 

**What lights your soul on fire?**

_That feeling of accomplishment. Seeing a project through from start to finish. Doing something I never thought I could do. There’s such a rush of excitement, of verification that I am smart and capable. That I can trusted with a task or a project and see it through and it be a success. It’s a really good feeling._

**Advice for people wanting to move in the direction of their dreams?**

_Take your time. Go at your own speed. Do it right the first time. This is where I’m at. I know that at some point, I want [Christine McCall Home](https://christinemccallhome.com/) to be an interior styling business with real clients, real homes, and real results. But I also want there to be a business plan, a process, a fulfilling experience for both myself and my clients. I’m in no rush, and I think there’s something very mature and respectable in knowing what you’re capable of and understanding how little or how much time it will take you to accomplish it the right way._

**Just for fun: If you could only eat one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be?**

_Ice cream. Without question. Ask anyone. My freezer is always stocked with ice cream. I’m single-handedly keeping Häagen-Dazs in business, people!_
