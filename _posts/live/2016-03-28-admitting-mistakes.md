I’m just going to come out and say, I make mistakes All. The. Time.

And for something that occurs so regularly, I find it really hard to admit they happen in the moment. My default, is to deflect. Why on earth I can’t bear to let a single person down, is beyond me.
Sometimes my inclination to deflect happens so instantly, I don’t even have time to stop the train before it leaves my mouth… It usually looks like something like this:

*Deflection:* Oh yeah, I was totally going to do that right after this other thing…
*Truth:* And by ‘totally going to do that’, I meant I totally forgot. So I’ll squeeze it in, somehow.

*Deflection:* Yep, I did that already.
*Truth:* I actually didn’t, but I’m going to NOW that you reminded me and pretend I already had done it.

*Deflection:* I’ve just been really busy, but I want to help.
*Truth:* I haven’t been busy. I just don’t really want to do this thing.

*Deflection:* Well, it’s actually not THAT bad.
*Truth:* I want you to think my mess up isn’t as bad as someone else’s.

On and on. We deflect, instead of just saying the unashamed truth and admitting mistakes. 

*But when we don’t make room for mistakes, we squeeze out any room for grace.*
We settle for cheap praise instead of deep grace.

Can we practice admitting mistakes? God knows we’ll have plenty opportunities to try.

This week’s #practicingimperfection challenge is: admit a mistake, right in the moment.

And instead of calling it an, epic fail, can we call it epic imperfection? Seriously. Leaving the keys in the car whilst running, when you’re already late and you have no shoes on is not a failure moment. It’s a real life moment. Its epic imperfection.
Little whoopsie, or huge let-down, lets own messing up this week.
