I often hear people wanting the results without the effort. 

They want to have a powerful yoga practice without getting on their mat every day. They want to master calligraphy the first time they pick up a pen. They want to have an eye for photography, without cultivating it. 
Somethings come easy in life, this is true. But most of the time, we start out terribly awful.
**Success comes from perseverance and has everything to do with staying power.**

It has to do with how many times you've tried and failed, and then got up and tried again the next day. It is try after try, day after day, that makes or breaks success. 
Want to cultivate something in your life? Stay with it for a while, and watch the process change you.

I am convinced the most rewarding things in life, are the things we endure for many seasons. The things we stick with. And not because they bear fruit the way we intended, but rather, because in the process of learning hard things, we are broken and put back together new.
