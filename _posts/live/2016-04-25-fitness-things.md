Points for creative post title, check.

I don’t swear by a lot of things in my fitness routine, but I do have a few things I would recommend when asked.

**Fitbit** // People often ask about my [Fitbit ChargeHR.](http://www.fitbit.com/chargehr) I have the purple one, naturally. June will mark one year of owning it, and I haven’t tired of it yet. They come out with new updates via the software, much like your Iphone, so your device doesn’t become obsolete every time they come out with a new feature.

It’s comfortable, easy to use and keeps me motivated to move my rear. My brother in law and husband wrote a comical [review](http://audaciousfox.com/2016/01/fitbit-hr-review) and I would definitely suggest reading the whole thing. If, for no other reason, because their quirky banter makes me giggle.

If you’ve been wanting to get one, the HR happens to be on sale this week until May 3. Run, don’t walk! Actually, who cares. You aren’t getting Fitbit credit for those steps, so they don’t count anyway. Ha.

**Foam Roller** // I couldn’t justify buying one of these for years. It’s legitimately, a block of foam. But I would use them at the gym and I knew they made a huge difference in working out muscle knots. So I decided to put it on my Christmas list, and santa brought me a purple foam roller.

My advice, get you one. If you lift, run, train heavy – you need it.

My mom just got herself one at [kohls,]( http://www.kohls.com/product/prd-1778822/black-mountain-products-36-in-extra-firm-high-density-foam-roller.jsp) where she used a coup!

**Glass water bottle** // I used plastic for a long time, because I didn’t think twice about it. But I switched from my plastic [Camelbak]( http://shop.camelbak.com/eddy-glass-7l/d/1113) to glass, and I really love it. Water doesn’t get as funky, and I’m told, it’s better than plastic. Even if the plastic is BPA free, I’m not cool with plastic “leaking things” into my water. It’s a bit heavier, but it’s got a nice silicon wrap on the outside, to keep it from breaking. And yes, it too, is purple.

**Exercise Ball** // Not for exercising, really, it’s for sitting at my desk. When I worked in the office I had it there with me. I now work at home and alternate between my chair and ball. I bought one appropriate for my height, and wait a minute… it’s not purple. Had to check just to be sure. It’s [this]( http://www.gaiam.com/product/extra-balance-ball-chair-ball/95-1472.html?dwvar_95-1472_color=charcoal#start=1) blue guy, from Gaiam.

**Manduka Yoga Mat** // This is my most recent investment, and I am definitely drinking the Manduka koolaid. My previous, TEAL colored yoga mat was from target. I probably spent a total of $20 on it and used it for about 4 years. It didn’t take long to realize it provided zero support, but I still couldn’t justify spending cash money on foam.

And then I started doing research. Manduka mats are lifetime guaranteed, and recommended by the pros. So what you’re paying for, is an investment in your practice. I bought the [navy blue prolite]( https://www.manduka.com/yoga-mats/pro/prolite-mat.html) 

Thank you, I know. It was brave of me to not get purple.
