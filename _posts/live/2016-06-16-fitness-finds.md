I live in my yoga attire. Not kidding. 

I also live on the extremes when it comes to my wardrobe. You’ll either find me in a dress, with hair and makeup done, or workout-gear and dry-shampoo’d hair. There is no middle ground for me. Usually, its yoga clothes or bust. And for whatever reason, the more colors I have on, the happier I feel. My husband says my “thing” is to see if I can wear ALL the colors at once. I say, he’s probably right. He also says that I only wear dresses, because I don’t like pants…He’s onto me.

It’s taken me a while to build my athletic wardrobe. I’m pretty intentional about what I own in terms of clothing. I’m a believer that less is more. I used to have a ton of options in my closet, for all occasions. Yet somehow, I always felt like I had nothing to wear. I figured out that too many options make nothing seem like a great option.  Having a smaller wardrobe, comprised of things I LOVE, ensures I never have a hard time deciding what to wear, because it’s all gold to me.

I don’t have a particular brand allegiance. Much like my color options, I’m usually a walking billboard for a variety of athletic brands. I do, however, shop almost exclusively at TJMaxx. I can get all the brands I love, for a fraction of the regular price. Here are a few items I love, and will continue to buy when the items I own become unwearable.

[New-balance capris](http://tjmaxx.tjx.com/store/jump/product/women-clothing-activewear-capris/Space-Dye-Capri/1000130411?colorId=NS1003462&pos=1:78&N=2755249271)
These are the bomb. They are like walking around in a cloud. Honestly, it’s like wearing no pants. Which, I now realize, is likely why I am obsessed with them. They are dry-wick material, ideal for sweaty days. I found them at TJMaxx for $20 and they are by far, the best $20 ever spent.

This line I have only been able to find at TJMaxx. Again, clouds for your legs. Softest material ever and the fit is really flattering. I have a few colors of these, and choosing my favorite would be like choosing a favorite child.

[Gaim bra](http://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2082607/gaiam-bra-shine-wire-free-low-impact-yoga-sports-bra-44-00001-womens.jsp?color=Black) Because bras with pretty backs make me happy. This one is low impact, so it’s ideal for yoga, but not for running.
[Adidas hat](http://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2395144/womens-adidas-studio-marled-baseball-hat-.jsp?ci_mcc=ci&utm_campaign=FASHION%20ACCESSORIES&utm_medium=CSE&utm_source=google&utm_product=30880564&CID=shopping15&gclid=CjwKEAjw4dm6BRCQhtzl6Z6N4i0SJADFPu1nzhHM8ys9CNNS8pi1ei6icR6N-gc-5S2jAD2MkAkdBoCAOfw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CK6ZnMails0CFUoFNwodveUF8g)

I have 3 hair styles: Washed and curled, unwashed and braided, and Ball cap. Oh, you didn’t know? Ball cap IS a hairstyle. I love this hat, when I’m out and about and my hair is less-than public appropriate, or when I want some extra protection from the sun. Sweat-wicking material makes it really comfortable and breathable.

Overall, my selections are based on 3 criteria: Material softness, versatility and price. I love really wild colored leggings, but I can only pair them with certain tops. So I try to make all of my clothing (both athletic an non) easily mix-and-matchable. Fewer restrictions equal more options. And that makes getting up early and doing sun salutations at sunrise, even easier.

Peace, love, and soft fabrics.
