This is for all the self-proclaimed road warriors.

Do you travel often for work? Live in your car more than your home? Does your mini-van spill out a weeks-worth of Starbucks cups and smelly soccer gear when you open the doors?

I don’t travel like I used to anymore. I work from home (glory be) and commute 1.5 hours from my country home to the city office twice a month. And even during those 4 days while I’m away from home, I feel like my momentum in choosing well is easily lost. I don’t have the ability to eat my normal foods, or workout at my normal times. It’s easier to not even try. I used to think – “I’m not in my normal routine, so what’s the use?”

I started realizing, this “my-way-or-nothing” attitude pointed to a level of inflexibility in my spirit. Routines can be life-giving, absolutely. But they can also be life-inhibiting when we believe they are the only way. _When we allow for flexibility in our day, we make room for unexpected gifts._

For me, traveling well is a simple balance of planning and flexibility. 

**Planning: Before**

Before I go, I make sure to stock up on a few things that make eating well easier. I prep oats and fruit, stock up on my favorite [larabars](http://shop.larabar.com/ALT-PROTEIN-Chocolate-Peanut-Butter/p/LARA-51063&c=LaraBar@Alt) and grab a few protein shakes. This [particular one](http://www.drinksvelte.com/) makes traveling fun because, hello, it tells me I’m beautiful. (Thank you, protein shake.)

These things travel well in a cooler, whether it’s to the soccer fields or the office. Eating things familiar to my body, helps to maintain a bit of normalcy for me while away from home.

**Planning: Day of**

Trying to get out the door on travel days, my inner dialogue reads – “my keys are in the freezer? Weird. Did I pack my blowdryer? Maybe I need more socks. Should I change my shoes now or when I get there? I hope I remembered my phone charger.”
Breakfast isn’t on my psycho mental list. But I make sure not to skip it.

I make my usual green smoothie and put it in my blender bottle to drink on the road. Boom – done. 1 minute breakfast, max.  

*Flexibility: While I’m there*

I always pack my gym gear (and yoga mat.) Because if I don’t have it, then I’m definitely not working out. This often proves to be the hardest part about traveling – finding the time and motivation. I am fortunate enough to have a new office building that has a gym and FREE yoga classes in the evening. (Yeah – that’s real. So I legitimately have zero excuses.)

Without this super rad set up, there are still options for staying fit on the road. Many gyms have a low drop-in rate for classes. It costs like $5 and you feel like a travel-genius afterward. Or, find out where co-workers go. Usually they can bring a guest to the gym for free or a one-time rate. 

If for whatever reason I can’t find time in my day to make it to the gym, I make sure to walk at every opportunity. I park far away in the parking garage, take the stairs, and go the long way to the restroom. Little choices can have big impact.

As far as food goes, I’ve got my system down pretty well. We have a super-cute cold pressed juice store one block away and I usually grab a kale-apple-lemon for when I need a mid-afternoon pick me up. The restaurant on the first floor of our building has a beet veggie burger I could eat every day. Admittedly, sometimes I do. When I find something I like, I’m not ashamed to eat it like it’s going out of style.

But sometimes, the system fails. Co-workers might want to go out for lunch (socializing? Ugh.) or we have meetings over lunch that get catered in and my veggie burger chow fest gets the kibosh. Whatever. It’s fine. I’m flexible, yeah? My rules for unexpected meal changes are– stay away from anything I wouldn’t normally choose. Beer-cheese fries sound ah-mazing, but my GI-tract will disagree later.

Did I mention to hydrate? Yeah. I water myself, all.day.long. Gives me energy, keeps me feeling fuller longer. Wherever I go, my water bottle goes too.

None of this sounds like rocket science, but if I didn’t do any of it I would sit at my desk, be tempted by the convenient vending machine crapola, and feel sluggish.

Honestly, the mental act of preparing makes me feel like I’m already winning. Even if everything else goes awry, I tried. And that, to me, counts as a win.

Try doing one thing different in your travel endeavors this week. Plan ONE thing ahead, and don’t try to uproot the whole system at once. 

There’s grace in living and traveling well!
