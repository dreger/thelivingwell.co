I have a hard time hitting my daily carb quota in a clean way. Veggies aren’t exactly high-carb. So I’ve been trying to come up with satisfying, filling, and clean ways to eat my carbs and I landed on grains.

At the end of every week, I usually have a random assortment of veggies, herbs, and almost-gone parmesan rinds in the fridge. My new thing is to make risotto with whatever I’ve got left. And because there’s something 5-star-feeling about creamy risotto, its luxury in a pan.

It’s super easy, here’s how it goes:
<br/>Sautee your veggies in olive oil (or butter because, butter.)
<br/>Toast your grains for a bit in the same pan.
<br/>Pour in organic chicken or vegetable stock.
<br/>Add herbs/spices.
<br/>Put pan right into oven. (make sure its cast iron or stainless steel)
<br/>Bake at 400 for 40ish minutes. (depending on the grain)
<br/>Done.

Legit, it’s that easy. The routine is the same, but the cast of characters looks different every time. Which makes it seem like you’re eating something totally new every week. When it comes to recipes, my battle cry is – flexibility. 

Here are some of my combinations. Pick one grain option, one veggie combo, one flavor profile and get to it. Then mix and match the following week.

##Grain options##
<br/> **Arborio Rice //** (the traditional grain for risotto.) I use a 1 to 4-cup grain to liquid ratio to get a super creamy texture
<br/> **Quinoa //** 1:2 ratio
<br/> **Farro //** 1:2.5 ratio

*Veggie Combos*
<br/> **1 //** Onion & garlic (every.single.time), Red bell Pepper, Sweet Potato
<br/> **2 //** Onion & Garlic, Zuchini, Brussel sprouts, cauliflower
<br/> **3 //** Black beans, red bell pepper, chopped spinach

*Flavor profiles*
<br/> **Mexican //** chopped cilantro, cumin, smoked paprika, black pepper, and some lime juice
<br/> **Fresh //** Chopped dill, juice of half a lemon, black pepper
<br/> **Caprese //** Chopped basil, balsamic vinegar, shaved parmesan
<br/> **Buffalo //** Hot sauce, juice of half a lemon

My favorite combo is Mexican#1, which is pictured above. Followed by Buffalo#2. Who am I kidding, I like them all.

Really, you could throw in anything you wanted. Whatever’s about to turn bad in the fridge, get it in the pan. And if you don’t have any of the herbs or spices to add in, it’s just as good with plain salt and pepper... And parmesan. Of course, parmesan.

Peace, love, and grain gains.
