My favorite thing to do in the kitchen, is come up with healthier recipes for classic comfort foods.

I love cookies, or biscuits, as they are called here in the UK. Strange, I know. 

I am an equal opportunity cookie eater. I don't discriminate. But alas, chocolate chip might be my favorite. 

To balance my PCOS diagnosis, I generally stick to a lower carb/high fat meal plan. The carbs I do eat, are mostly veggies and whole grains. So, white flour or store-bought cookies don't really fit the bill.

Enter: Almond cookies.

They are decadent. And, they resemble a traditional chocolate chip cookie. These ones don't taste like almond, per se. But you could sub out the vanilla extract, for almond extract and I bet those would be divine. Also, I bet subbing butter for coconut oil would make them taste more like a traditional cookie. But I prefer the health-profile of coconut oil for my fat intake.

**Stats:** Roughly 125 calories per cookie (almonds are high calorie, but oh so good for you.)
</br> 11grams Fat / 4grams Carb / 3grams Protein

**THE INGREDIENTS //**
1 cup almond flour</br>
2 1/2 tbsp coconut oil (melted)</br>
1-2 tbsp pure maple syrup. (I find 1tbsp is plenty sweet for me)</br> 
1 tsp vanilla extract (or almond. Oo! Or Mint)</br> 
1/4 tsp baking powder</br>
2-3 squares of dark cacao (70% is a nice balanace of bitter sweet)</br> 
Pinch of salt.</br> 

**THE METHOD //**
</br> Melt coconut oil, and let return to room temp (otherwise your chocolate will just melt)
</br> Combine wet ingredients in a bowl.
</br> Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.
</br> Mix together.
</br> The mixture will turn into a damp sand consistency. It won't hold together like a traditional dough.
</br> Chop chocolate squares into chunks, and fold in.
</br> Use your hands to roll them into one inch balls. They dough will stick upon compression.
</br> Place balls on cookie sheet, and lightly dimple the top with your thumb.

Bake at 350 for 5-7 minutes or until lightly brown. You dont want to bake them too long, as the moisture will leave them quickly.
Let cool on pan, to keep their shape. They crumble a bit when you eat them, but I somewhat enjoy that.

I keep mine in a glass container and eat them for breakfast, snack, and second breakfast. Yeah. That's a thing.

Bake well,
