It’s all the hype right now. Trendy or not, I will use this stuff until the day I die and here’s why.

I can use it for everything! Literally, everything. The best part is, a little goes a long way. Especially when used on your face or hair, a jar will last you a long time.

Just a few ways I use it regularly:

**In the Kitchen**
Add it to coffee for a kick of coconut. Swap it with butter. Use it for pan-frying in the kitchen – it’s incredibly stable and has a high smoke point.

**In the bathroom:**
No shaving cream? Coconut oil those legs.

Frizzy Hair day? Rub a tiny bit between your palms and smooth over frizz.

Dry hair? Use as a deep moisturizing mask once a week. A little goes a long way. Apply to ends and let hair steam under a shower cap while you shower. Or apply and sleep in it over-night.
Use it as lotion on your face, legs, anywhere.

It makes THE best eye make up remover. It removes more makeup than I even realized I had on, and does not clog your pores. I keep a small jar of it in the bathroom, separate from the one I keep in the kitchen. I cannot overstate this enough. Coconut oil for eye make up remover will change your life. Coconut oil for president! 
A word about coconut oil

Not all coconut oils are created equal. Look for virgin only and avoid partially hydrogenated oil. I use Trader Joe’s cold pressed organic coconut oil.  I buy two every time I go, because for $5.99, it’s a steal.  (Aldi now carries  organic too for about a dollar cheaper.)

Like all things – do your research. 

Peace, love, and coconuts.
