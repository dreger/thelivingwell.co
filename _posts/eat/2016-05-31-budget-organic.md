Eating well doesnt happen on accident. It takes thought, care, and preparation to eat well.

I should know. I make a lot of excuses for not planning my meals well.

Traveling too much, ran out of time and I don’t feel like it – are my most cited reasons.

I hear similar sentiments from others, adding comments like – The stores around here aren’t healthy, I’m not creative, and it costs too much.

Eating well all the time CAN happen for you. And it doesn’t have to look like spending your whole paycheck at Whole Foods, raising your own chickens or never eating out.

An unchanging attitude is the very thing that hold us back when it comes to making a positive change. We make up our mind based on what we’ve read or heard, and we don’t take time to find out for ourselves.

Decide what you want eating well to look like to for you, and then identify what your barriers are. For me, overcoming one mental barrier at a time seems to help me succeed in all areas of wellness. If I try to tackle everything at once, it’s too much and I’ll likely get overwhelmed and quit.

If my three bad-attitude thoughts are: It costs too much, I’m not creative, and I ran out of time – I focus on one of those things first, to figure out how to alleviate or lessen the issue. 

I’m going to share how I overcame three of my barriers to eating well, in a three post installment. 

The first- **It costs too much: Eating organic on a budget.**

Let me start by saying, you do not have to eat organic to eat well. Making an adjustment from processed food to whole food is a huge and life-changing step in itself. Again, it’s all about baby steps.

Over the last few years I decided to slowly converty to organic. Why? A lot of reasons, that I would urge you to [research]( http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/organic-food/art-20043880?pg=1) for yourself. Personally, the top reasons for me include: less exposure to chemicals, no added hormones, no GMO’s and better/sustainable care for the earth and livestock.

I started with a small portion of my groceries, targeting the [dirty dozen](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php) produce list. I figured I would start with the foods that are most commonly known to carry residual pesticides. Once I decided WHAT I was going to convert to organic, the bigger question became where to shop and how to afford it all. So naturally, I did more research.

At the time, I was living in a big city where my shopping options were ENDLESS. Within 10 minutes of our apartment I had the following stores: WholeFoods, Earth Fare, Kroger, Trader Joes, Walmart, Aldi, Giant Eagle, Raisin Rack – just to name a few.

My urge was to shop at the fancy places. In my head, a store like Aldi was just a dumping ground for almost-expired food to be steeply discounted. But by entering every store and evaluating them fairly, I learned that’s just not the case. 

You don’t have to buy organic food at expensive and branded stores. Sure, the experience you get at Whole Foods is drastically different than at Aldi. You don’t get spa water and tofu samples around every corner at Aldi. Heck, you don’t even get a person to bag your items and you need a quarter to use a shopping cart. But, you’ll soon forget about the lack of samples when you see your savings at check out.

After shopping around, my favorite and most reliable organic stops have come to include Walmart, Aldi and Trader Joes. 

Yep. You heard me. Walmart AND Aldi. Where we live right now, the selection of organic at the local grocery store pales in comparison to these two large stores. Before you get all judgy thinking “You don’t shop local? GASP!” Oh, hush. I do shop at a local health food store for pantry items and I patronize local farmers for my meat, which I’ll write about later. And if the local stores start carrying more/better organic options, I’ll certainly buy more there.

Ok, here’s the good stuff. I mean, the stuff that gets me straight-up giddy. I buy a lot of other things too, obviously, but I don’t think you care to read my entire grocery list. Maybe you do? 

Anyway, here’s a **list of organic things I buy at Walmart almost weekly:**
-Spinach <b/r>
-Bananas <b/r>
-Onions <b/r>
-Zucchini <b/r>
-Blueberries <b/r>
-Bell peppers <b/r>
-Avocados <b/r>
-Limes <b/r>
-Beans (pinto and black) <b/r>
-Arborio Rice <b/r>

The shopping cart pictured above is from Walmart. I left that trip with 20 items, but you’ll see some “items” contained multiples, like the onions and avocados. All told, I had everything listed above, plus tortilla chips, egg whites and almond milk and 5 packs of albacore tuna. I spent $42. 

**Easy math on that is roughly $2 an item, for a nearly all-organic cart.**

Those beans are $.92cents/can. Not too much farther down the same isle, they sell pre-made rice sides for $1 each. Rice with a ton of sodium flavored powder and hardly any nutritional value. For 8 cents cheaper you can get a can of organic black beans, spice them up at home, and you have a nutrient-dense, side dish with protein and fiber to boot.  

Makes sense, yes? It just requires a bit of thinking. 

At Aldi or Trader Joes, I get the following items organic, and they hold steady around these prices:
-Unsalted Peanut Butter: 3.99 all.day.long. (The ingredient list reads: peanuts. It makes my joy complete.) <b/r>
-Coconut oil: $4.99 <b/r>
-Quinoa: $3ish?<b/r>
-Chicken stock: Free range, organic, low sodium FOR TWO DOLLARS. Yeah. I’m yelling about it. Because you need tp know. <b/r>

Sometimes they’ll have organic beans, grains and lentils too. And you can usually find some organic spinach/greens. The thing about Aldi is, you never know what you might find. 

I go once a month and stock up on the above items they always have, and then whatever else I find roaming the isles. With Aldi, you never have to wonder if you’ll get a better price somewhere else. You won’t. You can shop anxiety-free knowing you aren’t missing a better deal elsewhere. Just check the dates, make sure packaging is sealed and fall yourself in love with that hodge-podge of a place. 
Mental barrier number one, overcome: Eating organic costs too much. It really doesn’t have to. It doesn’t have to be overwhelming. You don’t even have to shop at different stores.  It took me a while to get my system down, and it changes as the stores change. But I no longer enter the stores frustrated or overwhelmed. I know what I’m getting and I’m happy about what I’m spending.

Want to make the journey to organic? Pick a few things, and start there. Make one swap in your pantry every week. Like those pre-packaged sides I mentioned? Try swapping processed foods with something slightly better. I swear, when you cook it up and serve it you’ll feel really good about yourself, and your body will thank you, too. 

Peace, love, and organic eats.
