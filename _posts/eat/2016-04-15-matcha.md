I gave up drinking coffee for lent. Well, I decided I was only going to drink it once a week at Sunday brunch. Seemed resonable. Still, I wanted a bit of a pick-me-up. So I started making matcha lattes.

Then about a month into it, I noticed my skin had an inflamitory response to coffee/caffiene. Kill me now. Of ALL the things, my beloved betrayed me.

Luckily, I really enjoy my matcha latte. It doesn't upset my stomach and the energy boost is more sustained without a crash.

After Lent, I'm probably going to stick to coffee just once or twice a week.

Here's how I make it:
Unsweetened almond milk
Vanilla extract (or vanilla beans from the pod)
1/8 tsp coconut oil (I don't like it to be an oil slick)
