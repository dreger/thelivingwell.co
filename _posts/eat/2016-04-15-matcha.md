I gave up drinking coffee for lent. Well, I decided I was only going to drink it once a week at Sunday brunch. Seemed resonable. 

Then about a month into it, I noticed my face was no longer reddish in color and completely clear. For whatever reason, my body seemed to be happier without coffee. Kill me now. Of ALL the things, my beloved coffee had been betraying me.

Enter, matcha latte.

**What is matcha?**
<br> Matcha tea is a young tea leaf typically grown in Japan. It is high in antioxidants, amino acids, and chlorophyll. Matcha is known to have a relaxing effect on the mind and body. In addition, and probably my favorte feature, it gives you a pick-me-up with out the jitters. 

**Here's how I make it:**
<br>Unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk. I measure it in the mug I am going to drink it out of.
<br>Splash of vanilla extract (or vanilla beans from the pod)
<br>1/8 tsp coconut oil (I don't like it to be an oil slick)

Combine the above items on the stovetop, heat it slowly. 

<br> In your mug, add the matcha tea powder (use the amount on your packaging) and a small amount of hot water.
<br>Use a whisk (traditionally a bamboo one) to whisk briskly in a zig-zag direction to make a green paste.
<br>Pour heated milk mixture into the paste and stir. 
<br>The matcha will dissolve quickly and easily.
