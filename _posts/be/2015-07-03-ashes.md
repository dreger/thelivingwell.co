I wrote a post about trading ashes for beauty, simply out of love for the symbolism.

Ashes are a reminder that from dust we came, and to dust we shall return.

And in the midst of being of-dust and moving towards returning to dust, we often live among the dust.

Illness. Wounding. Death. Fear. Doubt. Lost dreams. Depression. Infidelity. Unending pain. Sometimes it's a whole pile of dust. A pile of ruins.

And all we can see are shades of gray and black. Smoldering and hazy.

And hearts can't help but wonder - how much is too much? When will this stop?

Season after season, when the hovering ashes get too heavy, a ray of light always trickles through. Straight to the innermost sanctuary of our spirit.

And He reminds us that he is not a God of scattering ashes. But a God of picking them up. It is not his intent to leave us as we are, ashed and broken. No. He is a resurrection God.

He breathes life into ashes. He resurrects them to something even more extraordinary than before they burned.

And our brokenness becomes our usefulness.

He lets the ruins come to life.

And when he does, how then, will you choose to live?

"Let the ruins come to life
In the beauty of Your Name
Rising up from the ashes
God forever You reign."
