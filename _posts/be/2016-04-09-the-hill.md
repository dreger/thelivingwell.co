Sometimes I just sit and ask God "why?" Why this season? Why that death? Why this pain? Often I feel his peace covering me. Other times, he speaks a word to my heart.

_I let you wander in darkness to remind you how blind you really are without me. So that when I lead you out of the valley season and to the mountain top, the light illuminates your world in a way you had not previously seen._

The valley seasons are hard. They last longer than they are welcome and they make my spirit raw.

But healing can't occur on callused skin. Healing isnt had where I have been closed off. No. Healing can only take place when my heart is raw and bleeding, completed exposed.

Thatâ€™s where love laid down scandalous grace - raw and bleeding - nail to tree. **He takes me there to meet me there.**

And when we blindly stumble through the valley, barely breathing, we can know - there's a healer on the hill. Arms open, calling us forth from the miry pit.

Whether the valley season is two days or two years, and all we see is more dark and more pain, look up.

**There's power in the valley and healing on the hill.**


_Come, let us return to the Lord. He has torn us to pieces, now he will heal us. Hosea 6:1_
