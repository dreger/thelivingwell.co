For some reason seeing my name at the top right corner of my bible stopped me dead in my tracks today.

I have had the same bible for some time, and never noticed  my name as a page reference in my concordance. My name is biblical, this I know. And surely I know its mentioned various times throughout all of scripture.

It's my name. I identify with it.  And today it stared back at me on the page.  It was as if God was trying to get my attention via page and ink.

Because when I looked at my name on THAT particular page, I realized - my name is on every page.

Your name is inked on every page, love. In every word, it is for you. I am for you.

The entire book is for me. Its for us. A love letter like no other. A world of life and discovery.

Sometimes old head-knowledge hits me like a brand new ton of bricks to the heart. The heart is where it counts - because the heart is where we change.

If  I laced within every thought, word and intention of mine the understanding that HE is for me no. matter. what... 

Oh, the freedom I would walk in. The love I would exude. The fear I would conquer. The sin I'd throw off.

What kind of kingdom living could I usher in without any fear? What kind of cross would I take up without tripping over old sin? The joy we have is in the finding out.

Head, meet heart. Sarah, meet God in a fresh - yet old - way. Today and everyday. His word is for us. He is for us.
