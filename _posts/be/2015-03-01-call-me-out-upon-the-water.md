This is my season of letting go. Asking God to call me out upon the water to test my faith.

To stand open handed and say - Take anything that is in the way of going where you're calling me.

I used to pray that prayer in a different way. I would ask The Lord to take what he must and refine me however he had to. And then immediately follow it up with "But dear God, please oh please don't take my family.. My husband.. My health..please don't."

As if he couldn't see right through my distrusting heart.

I never trusted God with my most beloved. I never trusted him with my "Isaacs." Abraham sacrificed his Isaac, his one and only beloved son. The very thing God had promised to him, he was willing to give away. He stood before God, hands open and told him to take what he must. He trusted God with his Isaac. And he got to walk back down the mountain with him.

But what if he didn't get to walk back down the mountain with Isaac. What if we didn't? It's the very thing I've always feared. What if I ask God to take what he must, and he actually does? What if my sacrifice is what he really wanted? I walk back down the mountain empty handed?

So I used to think.

He won't empty my hands without filling them back up. He won't take our Isaacs and leave us too. No. In his mercy He draws near in the emptiness.

He says - Let me be your Isaac. Let me be your all consuming love. These Isaacs, these gifts, are only a glimpse of the promises I will deliver to you. There is more. I am so much more.

No longer do I fear relinquishing my Isaacs to the loving hands that created them. I've opened my hands and I've let go. I pray it earnestly.

Now, the Isaac I can't bear to be without is the presence of my God. Take all else but if you won't go with me, Lord, don't ask me to go. Don't ask me to go If your presence won't go too.

Call me out upon the water to test my faith. Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander. Because I know - that you go too.

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
