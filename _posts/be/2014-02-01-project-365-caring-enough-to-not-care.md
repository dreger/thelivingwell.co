Today starts day 2 of my project 365: A year of nothing new.

Part of my struggle in being free from wanting things of this world is my deeply rooted need for acceptance.

I feel accepted by the world when they approve. When I fit in. When I'm not made fun of. When I have a place to belong. And while on the surface I feel "accepted", in my heart I know I still don't belong here.

My unsatisfied need for acceptance is made complete in the acceptance of God alone. Just as I am, broken and in need of constant repair. Often un-showered and in mismatching socks. Just as I am. There is freedom in this kind of acceptance. There is safety here.

I must admit, my ears have been tuned to hear, see and even crave the acceptance of the world loud and clear. Causing the voice of God to grow dim sometimes, preventing me from hearing how loved and accepted I really am.

Because to really hear The Lord speaking to the depths of my heart, I have to be still and listen. Listen willingly and teachably to what God wants to say.

Often when I'm still, the Martha (both the biblical sister and Martha Stewart can apply here) in me feels like I'm not being productive if I'm not completing something tangible. If I'm not cleaning, cooking, crafting, reading, working, serving, hosting. On and on.

But isn't it always in stillness and rest that my soul is sustained? It's where I know I'm loved. It's where, when I can muster up enough determination to break the shackles on my wrists that bind me to this life, I break free into deeper living.

I begin to hear again. The most beautiful symphony ever written. All for love. And its all for me.

It's the station I want my heart tuned to always.

Hearts tuned to the world outflow accomplishment as a means of acceptance.

Hearts tuned to The Lord outflow a love-driven and repentant life that is always accepted.

Hearts that care chiefly about loving and living for The Lord don't care about being accepted by the world.

Care enough about The Lord, and the rest of the cares become hazy. Care enough about the things The Lord cares about, and the "not caring" about the unimportant will follow.

This year, I pray the radio dial of your heart and mine can tune crisply to the voice of God alone. May the rest be static.
