I've been thinking about this and trying to write about it for the last month. Without further self scrutiny on my behalf, here it is.

In 2014, I am committing to going 365 days without shopping.

Why? Why not? If you think I've plum lost my mind, feel free to stop reading. If you're interested in watching me fail, or perhaps gracious enough to encourage me to succeed, read on.

Lately I've been wrestling with the Lord on having a heart as written in 1 John 2:15 //

> Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world. And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.

I live in this world, and I often love what is of it. I do. Guilty.

We live in the tension of the already and the not yet of the kingdom. My heart struggles daily examining my own inability to live a life radically abandoned to The Lord. I'm talking, radically abandoned here.

I love hearing stories of people who live amid the American dream and give it all up in order to live differently. People who sell just about everything they own, drive a beat up car, live in a tiny home, and yet have wealth abundantly that they give away. Families who have 16 children, and only half of them biological, because they'd rather see those kids live in a tiny house full of love, than to never know what it means to belong. People who go without tv or internet in order to get back to their roots of reading, writing, creatively playing old games and inventing their own genuine entertainment. People who quit their career, to open a shelter for women- sometimes not knowing themselves how they'll pay the electric bill. People who risk their lives for the sake of the gospel, caring not the slightest if their life is taken. The list goes on and on in big and small ways- each mattering the same.

The kind of radical living I want to embark on, is the kind that doesn't care about having things. Over the last year I have been making a larger effort to simplify what I own. Most often out of my closet - Clothes, shoes, accessories. However often times after I've cleaned out my closet, I find justification in buying more. I've made room, only to fill it with...More stuff.

I still find myself buying a "deal I cant refuse" or a fabulous thrift find. Oh, do I find thrill in a good thrift!

The things I buy are not a need, but rather - "its a great deal, so why not?" Or my famous line "I only have blue, black, gray and green cardigans - red and brown are missing so I need those too".

My use of the word need has become a bit scary. I need to drink water. I don't need, to drink Starbucks. I need to wear clothes. I don't need to have a different outfit for every day, or a different dress for every wedding we attend in a year.

I get concerned that someone will see me wear the same dress over and over to multiple weddings in one year? Millions are concerned they'll even have enough threads to cover their freezing bodies in the dead of winter.

Oh, my aching heart. How have I unknowingly become wrapped up in the never-content world around me?

During this season of thanks, I find gratitude met with pain. Pain deep in my heart for those who have nothing, and no one to notice that they don't. The person on the side of the road who doesn't know where their next meal will come from. The millions who make their homes among landfills. The mother who walks for miles just to find a bit of food for her starving children, and keeps nothing for herself.

I have an aching heart for the world - created in me by knowing my savior. But while my heart aches- what great sacrifice am I making to help others? What is my radical call to action? Saying I care, donating my time and money- but still living the American dream? Hardly sacrificial.

Chris and I try our best to not live in great excess. To hold the things of this world loosely. We strive to be good stewards of what The Lord has given us. We've saved a great deal of money this way and have been able to bless others along the way.

Then I started asking myself: What is the reason we own anything other than what we need? The answer isn't even really because "we want" but rather simply because we can. Because we have the resources to have not just a home, but one filled with things. And we live in a society where the ability to have things becomes a right, and we forget anything we claim ownership of isn't actually ours.. Nothing ever is.

But instead of fully living like every penny to our name belongs to The Lord, we blindly live the way the rest of our culture does. Indulging simply because we have enough to do so...just because we can. Because we can??

Really? I don't want to want things because I can. That's not the truest desire of my heart.

What I want, is to live a life radically and wholly abandoned to the Lord.

I want to give away more - because I can.

I want to live more simply - because I can.

I want to use every penny I can spare to feed the hungry -

because I can.

I want to randomly bless others with my money - because I can.

I want to be content with what I have - because I can.

I want to put others first - because I can.

I want to stop swimming upstream with the American dream - because I can.

I want to live radically different, just because I can.

I want to make room in my life for more of Christ to enter in. More room, less stuff.

In order to shift my heart, I'm doing something Ill only be able to succeed at if you stop to say a prayer for me from time to time.

I'm not the kind of person who can be half-in and be successful when it comes to pruning off unfruitful things in my life. It's cold turkey, or no progress.

I'm going 365 days without shopping. Clothes, shoes accessories and the like. Yes. You heard it here first. I've got one of everything I need (really, I don't need a brown and red cardigan as well) and unless I have an excessive weight gain or loss, there's no need for purchasing more. If certain items become too terribly worn or break - I'll purchase on what I'll call an "as desperately needed" basis. It'll be case by case, and I'm not even really sure what the rules are. I'll get to those later.

The point is - I'm changing my idea of need so that I can better use the resources God has given me.

I'm reducing what I own, so that others might have more. I'm willingly laying down my "right" to have, in order that I might be more free to give.

My plan is to keep track of instances where a desire to "have" rises in my heart. I'm going to take note of the price, drop that amount in a jar and see what I've got at the end of one year. Half we'll save, and half we'll give away.

It is in sacrifice that my heart discovers an unmatched depth of intimacy with the Lord. He ushers me in and shapes a new heart.

A radically changed heart is what I'm after here.

This world is fading away, along with everything that people crave.

He knows I crave it and struggle with it. And I know it will only fade away. So why not become free from my bondage to it - free from my love of things.

Ill be blogging about the journey, once a week or so. Anyone want to join me? Is there anything you've come to think you "need" that The Lord might be calling you to do without? What does this challenge of giving up look like for you? I'd love to have a few others join me on the journey.

I’ve made great progress this year, thanks to the grace of The Lord working in my heart. But Like anything in life, can’t I always do better? Cant I always give more?

Join me in a year of giving up, in order to give.
