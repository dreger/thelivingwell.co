I've seen all kinds of posts going around titled "20 things to do in your 20's" or some rendition of that.

With every version I read, I just don't get it. Aspirations are great, but why must we put an age on it?

Are your twenties the only years that you can accomplish your dreams, try new foods or be spontaneous? And are your 30's solely dedicated to raising children or solidifying your career? What, then, are you to do when you find yourself 40, childless, and not in the profession you hoped to be?

My gut reaction is a cringing "that better not be me". But why? Why must we deem life activities "age appropriate". I suppose prime-child bearing years have much to do with the push to have children earlier, for the health of both mother and child. I get that.

But what about everything else? I've got 4 years left of my twenties (wait, what?) And I don't even know what I want to be when I grow up. I need to make lists, I need to set goals, I need to be proactive, I need to get out of this rut, I need to hurry up and figure it all out right now. 

And amid my frantic attempt at list making, the Lord spoke over it.

Age is not a benchmark by which I measure your life. Nor are the goals you achieve or the degrees you obtain, or the places you go. Focus instead on what I've given you, and how you respond to me.

Its about how we respond.

How do you respond to being what seems like, the only person left on the planet who isn't married. Attending wedding after wedding, accumulating bridesmaid dress after bridesmaid dress. You are the real-life bachelorette in the movie "27 Dresses". You celebrate the joyous occasion for everyone else, while all your heart really desires is someone to live life with.

How do you respond to not having your dream job? While the rest of your friends are changing the world battling injustice, entering into pastoral ministry, working in beautiful cities at jobs that they love. You find yourself plugging away at a job you're somewhat good at, but its not what moves your soul - its not really your life call. Maybe you don't even know what that call is. But you're here now, in a place that seems in-between. Because the Lord isn't ready to deliver yet. Its not yet your season.

How do you respond to loss? The death of a spouse, mother, unborn children. The loss of a failed marriage. The loss of passion for something that once burned like a fire within. Hearts come undone over loss.

How do you respond to being broken-hearted? Over failures, broken relationships, addictions, depression, debt, etc., etc.

How do you respond to the very things you wouldn't wish upon anyone else?

Our response, our attitude of the heart, is what deepens the roots of our faith when we feel like its hanging on by a thread.

We tend to want to fast forward through anything hard. Anything we don't particularly love, or anything that hurts. We hurry up and God beckons "slow down".

We cannot trade our ashes for beauty if we have not yet endured the smolder. If we have not allowed our hearts to grieve, laid down our pride or surrendered our situations to the hand of God - we will come out of the season worse for wear.  If in every season, we dot not take it for exactly what it is - our souls will never grow.  If we don't stop to be present where we are, time slips through our hands and in a blink - it passes by.

We need to stop and respond.

Because maybe there's more to be had in this season than just waiting for the next thing to come. Maybe this season is preparation for what is to come. Maybe the NOW is about getting our hearts ready for the not yet. Because when the next season gets here, I don't want to be unprepared. I want to stand before it, heart willing and ready saying "I haven't wasted anytime. I am right where I need to be".

With gratitude and anticipation, Let all that I am praise the Lord.
