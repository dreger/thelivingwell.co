No other question has tripped me up lately like this one has. When talking about future plans for C and I, this question keeps getting asked, in some way shape or form…

“I hope that [moving across the country] is what you want.”

“I hope [leaving Ohio] is what you want to do.”

“I hope [whatever is next] will make you happy.”

“Don’t you want to be where your family is?”

Me: “Uhh. I’m not really sure yet..? I’m cool with whatever.”

Real talk? This conversation annoys the heck out of me. 

Maybe because I have no clue how to respond. Maybe because, I’m not really sure what I want? No, that’s actually not it. 

It’s not that I don’t _know_ what I want. **It’s that God has yet to reveal to me what my dreams look like fully realized.**

Because what I want, isn’t limited to time and space and occupation. What WE want, is to live under the direction of God, no matter what. To not set our sights solid on one single location or vocation, until he speaks it to be so. To live completely and entirely open handed to what God wills to give us.

What do I want? I want what God wants. 

Where do I want to go? I want to go where He leads. 

And God hasn’t revealed to us where that is yet.

Instead of me telling God what I want this to look like, I’m going to keep dreaming with an open heart. I’ll keep seeking, asking, and knocking and have open arms to receive whatever he has. Because I know even my best dreamed-up-dreams, pale in comparison to what he wants to write on the pages of my life. It's always more.

When C and I got married, we wrote our vows to include Ruth1:16 “Where you go I will go. Where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.”

We vowed this to each other, yes, but to God, first. We go where He goes, and we stay where he stays. And we only go, _because he goes._ Whether he has us there for 6 months or 6 years. We go.

God keeps drawing me back to the book of Numbers, 9:15. 

**The fiery cloud**
<BR>*“On the day the Tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered it.  But from evening until morning the cloud over the Tabernacle looked like a pillar of fire. This was the regular pattern—at night the cloud that covered the Tabernacle had the appearance of fire.*
 
 *Whenever the cloud lifted from over the sacred tent, the people of Israel would break camp and follow it. And wherever the cloud settled, the people of Israel would set up camp. In this way, they traveled and camped at the Lord’s command wherever he told them to go. Then they remained in their camp as long as the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle.  If the cloud remained over the Tabernacle for a long time, the Israelites stayed and performed their duty to the Lord.*
 
 *Sometimes the cloud would stay over the Tabernacle for only a few days, so the people would stay for only a few days, as the Lord commanded. Then at the Lord’s command they would break camp and move on. Sometimes the cloud stayed only overnight and lifted the next morning. But day or night, when the cloud lifted, the people broke camp and moved on.*
 
 **Whether the cloud stayed above the Tabernacle for two days, a month, or a year, the people of Israel stayed in camp and did not move on. But as soon as it lifted, they broke camp and moved on. So they camped or traveled at the Lord’s command, and they did whatever the Lord told them through Moses.”**

Wherever the spirit of the Lord went, the Israelites went too. Regardless of how quick their stay was, they always went. And they went knowing that the Lord went before them. They moved, when he moved.

**He goes before us, always. He hovers where we are, and wherever his spirit is, there is freedom to fully live.**

Right now, we’re OK not knowing what our next move looks like. God knows.

We’re just waiting on the fiery cloud to move.
