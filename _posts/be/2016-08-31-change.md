You're allowed to change and grow. 

You're allowed to drop old stories that no longer serve you. 

You're allowed to identify as someone different than your past once dictated. 

You're allowed to expand thoughts, change your mind, and broaden horizons. 

You're allowed to be different tomorrow than you are today. 

Who you are becoming, is your real self. Shedding layers, dropping narrative and softening the heart is only part of the process. 
Every day we get to start over. And every day, we can choose to move towards being our most true self. 

My God, what a freeing way to live.
