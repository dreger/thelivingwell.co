And just like that the year was through.

365 days of nothing new.

(If you want to police me, it was actually 360 days, as I decided to end my year the weekend of Christmas. Sorry to disappoint.)

360 days is a lot of days. It's 8,640 hours. 518,400 minutes. And I am proud of it.

I'm humbled by what God chose to do through me this year and amazed at my ability to garner a stronger self discipline.

There is so much cleansing to be had when we practice saying no.No to expectations. No to societal norms. No to spending money on unnecessary things.

A soulful no is an honoring one when the Holy Spirit prompts it. And a whole-hearted yes has the power to transform when we invite God into it.

I was intentional this year about asking God to reveal more about my true self. More about who he created me to be. More understanding of how vast his love for me really is.

Change has happened this past year. It's what I wanted, and it's what I got.

Here's what I'll leave my project 365 followers with.

You won't change just by wishing you would. You won't be a different person without putting in the work. How much you sacrifice determines how much you reap.

You really, really want to do all the things you swear you're "working on?" Take every obstacle out of the way. Invite God into it. And run.
