On my 25th birthday I gave myself a trio of life statements:

Jesus is life. Nature is love. Simplicity is freedom.

This year I'm intentionally exploring what a more simple life looks like in a variety of ways.

Simple thoughts. Not uneducated or un-opinionated. Just simple. No anxious what-ifs or bantering what-could-have-been. Simply thinking in the now. Tuning into the present moment and all it has to offer. Freeing my thoughts to focus on what my soul actually needs.

Simple things. Haven't you heard? Less is the new more. Because when you own a multitude of things, they end up owning you.

Simple living. Eating well. Taking care of my body and my spirit. Making time for yoga. Pausing to be still and listen to God. Not feeling guilty in turning down yet another social gathering - because sometimes you just need the time to breathe. Practicing silence and solitude more often.

Simple speech. No slander, gossip, foul talk, judgement or jest of others. No falsities or saving-face statements. Just pure honesty and honorable speech.

Simple love. Loving people for exactly who they are and where they are. Championing them to be the best version of themselves.

Simple gifts. Giving God my first fruits instead of my sloppy seconds. Better using the spiritual gifts he has given me and not wasting any opportunity to pray over, bless, or shepherd those he has entrusted to me.

Simply freedom. From my own insecurities that keep me from embracing who I am. From caring about what others think. From wanting things of this world. From my own chains I keep carrying around.

Believe it. The simple things can set you free.
