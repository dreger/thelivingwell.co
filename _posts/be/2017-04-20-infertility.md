If you were to ask me "when are you having kids?" I would probably have a strong desire to punch you. It's nothing personal, honest. I just **hate** this question. 

For most women, it's relatively easy to answer:

<br>When we have a house. 
<br>When we are this age. 
<br>When we pay off debt.
<br> When we feel God prompt us.

The _when_ of it, is seemingly in their hands. I don't know what that's like.

My answer to this question, is a shoulder shrug. Sometimes when I'm feeling real cheeky, I am inclined to say "when sperm meets egg." But some audiences don't appreciate that sort of biological humor. And since most people ask because they genuinely want to know, a smart-ass remark doesn't seem the most gracious. 

To be honest, I haven't found a way to talk about it yet. It's not easy to explain, because my answer is: _I don't know._

I deal with infertility, in the form of [PCOS.](http://www.pcosaa.org/) For some women, a life-style change and medication can lead to a succesful pregnancy. And then, there are many of us who have tried everything with no luck. I know atleast a dozen women who live in my boat, and its estimated that 10 million women worldwide live with PCOS. Each with a varying degree of the same diagnosis. And each of us are routinely told the same thing: _you have a lot of options._ 

I know I have options. I also know the odds aren't overwhelmingly in my favor, and most cost more money than we have. When people learn about my condition, they immediately ask about the options. "What does your doctor say? Have you tried this diet? This supplement? Have you considered IVF? You can always adopt..."

I get it, I do. Its hard to make sense of something so complicated, and so under-discussed. Understanding my diagnosis through the lens of what can be done, and how it can be fixed seems easier to digest. 

I spend my days planning meals, calculating levls of nutrients and monitoring how my body responds. When I visit the doctor we talk numbers and hormones. Its always about the fixing. Always about what more I could be doing, or foods I should be trying. 

But here's the problem: _Conversations that focus on fixing instead of feeling, prohibit healing._ **Because fixing, isn't the same as healing.** And if the conversations are always about fixing and doing, it doesnt leave room for us to heal and _just be._

You probably don't hear a lot of women talk about infertility. Its not that we don't want to. Largely, even the most well-intentioned conversations just don't feel free. _They feel fixated on fixing._ They limit the space where I can speak freely about the range of emotions and seasons that accompany infertility.

In this particular season, I don't have a _burning_ desire to have children. I also feel like I don't have the freedom to say that. I feel judged whenever it leaves my lips. I usually get some rendition of "well, no one is ever _fully_ ready to have kids," or "you'll change your mind!"

It's not that I don't want children. I do. After all, mentoring is what I love. My heart burns to champion the real self of another soul. To spend my life drawing out the authentic self of my own children? I can think of _nothing_ more sacred.

I feel this way right now, because I don't feel entitled to anything in this life. Everything is a gift, not a given. The minute I start thinking of things in terms of what I _should_ have by now, the joy leaves.

Its true, just about every month someone else I know gets pregnant. And if I can be brutally honest here? I hope I can. Sometimes **my heart can't celebrate the way I know it should.** The joy feels tinged by my own "why not me?" pain.

But it doesn't change what I know to be true: **my life will not be less-full, if I am child-less.** And I remind myself to come back to the gift of the present moment.

#Joy comes in the tender moments where I let go of expectations, and recieve what is right in front of me.

This is my first time writing about infertility, and I don't intend to stop. I want to change the conversation from fixing to feeling. We are more than our diagnosis, and we are not defined by our lack. 

When you're navigating inevitable pain and uncertaintly, sometimes all you need is someone to ask "how is it with your soul?" 

And then, we hold safe the space for one another to speak. _Thats how we breathe a little living into each other's dark days._

honestly,
<br>Sarah Kay
