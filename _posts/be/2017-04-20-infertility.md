If you were to ask me "when are you having kids?" I would probably have a strong desire to punch you.

It's nothing personal, honest. I just hate this question. For most women, it's relatively easy to answer. 

<br>When we have a house. 
<br>When we are this age. 
<br>When we pay off debt.
<br> When we feel God prompt us.

The _when_ of it, is seemingly in their hands.

My answer to this question? Shoulder shrug. Sometimes, when I am feeling real cheeky, I am inclined to say "when sperm meets egg." But some audiences don't appreciate that sort of biological humour. And, since most people ask because they genuinely want to know, a smart-ass remark doesn't seem the most gracious. 

To be honest, I haven't found a way to talk about it yet. It's not easy to explain. Largely because my answer is: I don't know.

I deal with infertility, in the form of PCOS. For some women, medication can fix the issue. But there are many more of us, where that is not the case. 

I know atleast a dozen women who live in my boat. Each with a varying degree of the same diagnosis. And each of us are routinely told the same thing: you have a lot of options. 

I don't really care about options. I care about awareness. 

I'd like to inform the space where people with barren wombs won't be made to feel like a lesser-woman. I want people to start understanding that pregnancy is not just a given, it's a gift. A miraculous one. And just because you "accidentally" got pregnant, doesn't mean that it's really, that easy, for everyone else.

In this season of life, I don't have a burning desire to have children. I also feel like I don't have the freedom to say that. I usually get some rendition of "well, no one is ever fully ready to have kids," or "you'll change your mind!"

It's not that I don't want children. I do. After all, mentoring is what I love. My heart burns to champion the real self of another. To spend my life drawing out the authentic self of my own children? I can think of nothing more sacred.

I feel this way, because I have my hands held entirely open. I don't feel entitled to that gift. I am not demanding it. 

Ithe need to keep up with my friends. Sometimes, I do feel left out. That reality is real. But it doesn't change what I know to be true: my life will not be less full, if I am childless. I am certain of it. 

Whether or not I can bear children has never been within my control. It's a story God has yet to unfold. And while  I'm watching, I'm not waiting for that season of life to start. Because then I miss out on what is right in front of me.

The thing about life is, you never get to return to any one season. Ever. Each one holds something different. So instead of wishing this one away, I'm expectantly reviving it all. I feel full and content, alive and hopeful. Holding hands open to let go and receive every single thing in my life as a gift. Never a given. 


In the nearly 4 years since my diagnosis, I've exhausted energy changing my life. I have explored every eating habit imaginable. I have tried terrible tasting supplements and natural remedies. I've gotten three different opinions on the matter. They all say the same thing: you have a lot of options.





But options aren't really what I want. I'd like answers. Answers as to why my diagnosis, is so far different than what medical research currentl
