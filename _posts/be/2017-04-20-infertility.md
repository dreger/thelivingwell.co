If you were to ask me "when are you having kids?" I would probably have a strong desire to punch you. It's nothing personal, honest. I just hate this question. For most women, it's relatively easy to answer. 

<br>When we have a house. 
<br>When we are this age. 
<br>When we pay off debt.
<br> When we feel God prompt us.

The _when_ of it, is seemingly in their hands.

My answer to this question? Shoulder shrug. Sometimes when I'm feeling real cheeky, I am inclined to say "when sperm meets egg." But some audiences don't appreciate that sort of biological humor. And since most people ask because they genuinely want to know, a smart-ass remark doesn't seem the most gracious. 

To be honest, I haven't found a way to talk about it yet. It's not easy to explain, because my answer is: _I don't know._

I deal with infertility, in the form of [PCOS.](http://www.pcosaa.org/) For some women, a life-style change and medication can lead to a succesful pregnancy. And then, there are many of us who have tried everything with no luck. I know atleast a dozen women who live in my boat, and its estimated that 10 million women worldwide live with PCOS. Each with a varying degree of the same diagnosis. And each of us are routinely told the same thing: you have a lot of options. 

I know I have options. I also know the odds aren't overwhelmingly in my favor, and most cost more money than we have. When people learn about my condition, they immediately ask about the options. I get it. Its hard to make sense of something so complicated, and so under-discussed. Understanding my diagnosis through the lens of what can be done, and how it can be fixed seems easier to digest. 

I spend my days planning meals, calculating levls of nutrients and monitoring how my body responds. When I visit the doctor we talk numbers and hormones. Its always about the fixing. Always about what more I could be doing, or foods I should be trying. 

_Conversations that focus on fixing instead of feeling, prohibit healing._ **Because fixing, isn't the same as healing.**
And if the conversations are always about fixing and doing, it doesnt leave room for us to heal and _just be._

#I want to change the conversation from fixing to feeling.#

I want to encourage awareness andwhere a woman like me can be free to grieve or grin and not feel like she needs to explain why. A space where women with barren wombs won't be made to feel like a less-than female.

You probably don't hear a lot of women talk about infertility. Its not that we don't want to. Largely, even the most well-intentioned conversations don't feel free. _They feel fixated on fixing._ They limit the space where I can speak freely about the range of emotions and seasons that accompany infertility.

In this particular season, I don't have a _burning_ desire to have children. I also feel like I don't have the freedom to say that. I usually get some rendition of "well, no one is ever fully ready to have kids," or "you'll change your mind!"

It's not that I don't want children. I do. After all, mentoring is what I love. My heart burns to champion the real self of another. To spend my life drawing out the authentic self of my own children? I can think of nothing more sacred.

I feel this way right now, because I have my hands held entirely open. I don't feel entitled to the gift of children. I am not demanding it. This is how I feel.

I don't feel the need to keep up with my friends. But sometimes, I do feel left out. I keep watching friends grow into other seasons of life, while I watch from the outside. Conversations are slowly becoming kid-centric, and the gap between us feels wider. This is my reality.

But it doesn't change what I know to be true: **my life will not be less-full, if I am child-less.** I am certain of it. 

Whether or not I can bear children has never been within my control. It's a story God has yet to unfold. And while I'm watching for it, I'm not sitting around waiting for it. If I wait for that season of life to start, I miss out on right now.

The thing about life is, you never get to return to any one season. Ever. Each one holds something different. So instead of wishing this one away, I'm expectantly reviving it all. I feel full and content, alive and hopeful. Holding hands open to let go and receive every single thing in my life as a gift. Never a given. 

Because the thing about God is, his plan for my life has always been infinitely more than my heart could even imagine. Its always more. Child-ful or child-less, my God never gives me less than what is best.

honestly,
<br>Sarah Kay
