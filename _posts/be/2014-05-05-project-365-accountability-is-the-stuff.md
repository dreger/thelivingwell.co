I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of texts, phone calls, emails and Facebook messages. The love I have received in the last week, and today especially, has been humbling.

What started as a small idea in my head, has rippled into something much bigger, and I am only 14 days in.

Today I spoke on on the radio about my project. What I'm doing and how on earth I even got the idea. And at the end, they asked if they could follow up with me various times in the coming months - allowing their entire listening audience to hold me accountable for the next year. I wholeheartedly agreed saying "I need the accountability!"

And then I realized something. Today, for me, was a testament to the gift of accountability within the body of Christ.

There is such power  in accountability. Great vulnerability, but great reward to the one who can openly admit shortcomings, and let the body of Christ not only encourage you, but CHEER YOU ON relentlessly to overcome.

And not just from the sidelines- but walking along side in the trenches and even joining in. That's real community.

Community is where we bear our souls when they are defeated, shamed, embarrassed and in need of repair - knowing it is where we can begin true restoration.

And when you catch a glimpse of the insurmountable support even in small endeavors, it gives flight to your wings.

If THIS is the support I receive when I decide to not shop for a year, my heart all-but-bursts in thinking, how much more will I be loved in my darkest of days? It gives me chills to my core. I pray I never take it for granted.

Big or small, whatever it is you're clinging to, whatever is holding you back, it's worth uprooting. It's worth telling someone about. It's worth laying down your pride for. It's worth letting go of.

And when you decide you want to let go, find community. Find your cheer-leading section. Surround yourself with people who will champion you to be the best version of yourself. Find those people. Because we simply weren't made to do life alone.

Everyone needs championed.

Coming up short? Let me know, Ill point you in the right direction. Because community is that important.
