I used to get made fun of in middle school. A lot. My skin was always pale. I was never popular. My hair, had a life of its own. I spent most of my middle and high school years in braces. I was too shy to speak up for myself. I had one best friend.

And in 7th grade I had one purple sweater I really loved. It was my favorite. I probably wore it over most of my outfits, more than once a week. I never thought twice about it.

I'm sure mom said something about it, but never mind what mom says about fashion when you're 12. My best friend made a comment or two like "You really like that sweater, don't you?". I would smile and nod, and stare back out the yellow bus window.

It wasn't until one day in math class, I realized no one else loved that purple sweater as much as I did.

The girl behind me said "Hey Sarah, nice sweater." Kids nearby snickered. Was there some joke about my sweater I didn't know about? "Wear that one already every day this year?" Chimed in someone else. More kids snickered, louder. My face burned red. "I think my grandma has the same one, but she stopped wearing it a few years ago". I could feel tears in my eyes. I knew better than to let them see me upset. I had been in this boat before.

I mustered a laugh and said "funny joke...I guess it is old." They laughed. "Why don't you buy a new one? Can't you afford it?"... I had plenty in my closet. My parents could afford it. But broken to pieces is my heart...for the kids who endure this banter every day, because their parents cannot.

My closet had enough. But purple I happened to like best.

Luckily the teacher, not knowing the conversation, reminded us it was quiet time. They stopped laughing. But my anger boiled.

I wanted to slink under my desk and never come out. I wanted to fake sick and run out of the room.

That class never lasted so long. Time stood still. I bit back tears the whole time.

To this day I'll never forget her name or face. You never forget the kid who made the whole class laugh at you.

When the bell rang I bolted to my locker. I threw the sweater to the bottom and slammed the door behind me. My once beloved sweater was now the thing I hated most.

And I never wore it again. Or anything for that matter more than once in the same week. Lesson learned.

So often I was victim of bullying for what I wore. I guess at that age, I really didn't care as much about fashion as the other girls did. I never tried new trends because I was too afraid people would say something mean. I never wanted to stand out. I just wanted to wear what I liked, and hoped somehow I fit in.

And whether I was accepted or rejected was determined solely by the brand names on my tags. The variety of sweaters I donned every week. And whether my jeans were long enough to not be considered floods.

My self worth hinged on a hanger. I was only ever as good as my clothes were.

And still today, I feel much the same. What we wear sets us up for public praise or ridicule. Magazines have sections dedicated to "who wore it best?" And the morning after any award show the buzz is all about who wore what name, and how did they pull it off.

We are hung up over hangers. Souls get lost under threads and brands. People get torn to pieces and spirits are damaged.  And my heart just wonders, how did we get this way?

I'm not sure how clothes have come to matter more than the person wearing them- but I'm ready to live differently. And after enduring years of sweater slander,  I want to dig up my "purple sweater".

At age 25, I'm choosing to challenge the status quo and wear my "purple sweater" again. For the next year, I'm choosing to wear the same clothes over and over, because I'm convinced I really don't need any more. And for me, that's okay.

Because this time around, purple is enough.  And my purple sweater means so much more than a simple piece of clothing. Its a way of living.

Because there's a lesson to be learned from 7th grade me that I want to reclaim. The 7th grade me who, somehow, went a long time without overhearing the hateful words. The 7th grade me who wore her purple sweater because she chose it for her own.

The me who smiled out the bus window, probably humming the same old Disney songs, donning my purple sweater and blissfully unaware of how hurtful the world around me was.

The me who wore whatever I wanted, in style or not, simply because I didn't care otherwise.

I was free from the world. And I was free to love who I was.

I want that freedom back. I want my purple sweater back. I'm digging it up from my 7th grade locker.

Deciding to wear proudly what lot or little I have in life. Re-learning to love who I am, not based on what I wear.

7th grade Sarah, bet you'd never imagine this...I'm choosing my purple sweater again. And rocking it proudly.
