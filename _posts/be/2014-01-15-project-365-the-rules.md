Tomorrow starts my Project 365: A year of nothing new. For my own accountability, I thought it best to have an outline of what my year ahead will look like. For those of you wanting to join me on this journey, pick your own set of rules and commit! This doesn't have to look the same for everyone.

1. Clothes will be purchased on an "as desperately needed" basis. When basic clothing necessities break, wear out or become simply unwearable - purchases will be allowed. Outer clothing (shirts, pants, shoes, etc) must be purchased second-hand. Undergarments can be new.
2. Special Occasions are the exception. What the bride says - goes. And since I am a part of 3 weddings this year, Ill be obliging bridal requests. Lucky for me, both bridesmaids dresses and shoes were purchased in 2013, so I should be good to go.
3. Items can be received as gifts, but not asked for. If the item falls under \#1 as a need, you may ask others to purchase for you if its birthday/holiday time.
4. The term "Clothing items" includes clothing, shoes, purses, and all accessories. By extension, other off-limit items include but are not limited to: House decor, cosmetics (other than basics), excessive beauty products, overindulging in coffee.. etc.
5. Books, journals, office/organization supplies and educational materials, are allowed to be purchased for self. Other things may fall into this category as deemed necessary such as home DIY projects.
6. Gifts for others do not count and may be purchased freely. Its fun to give :)
7. Any time a temptation to buy or desire to have arises, the amount will be kept track of.

If you're joining me, commit to writing about it at least once or twice! Be sure to let me know if you're in for the 365 days or even just a week, or month. Id love to follow your journey.

Here's to 2014. A year of giving up, in order to give.
