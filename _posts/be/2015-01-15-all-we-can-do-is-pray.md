I was on the phone with a friend, detailing a sad situation involving someone close to me. She was mourning a recent and tragic loss of someone in her life. On and on we talked. Sick stomachs and broken hearts over the pain we endure in this life.

And at the end of our call I offered a familiar, yet empty sentiment. One that came out of my mouth, because I had no other words to offer. No means by which to solve the issues at hand in any immediate fashion.

..."Well. All we can do is pray."

No sooner the words left my lips, I heard the emptiness ring back. The routine sentiment coming off my own tongue shocked me. It embarrassed me actually, that I had chalked up prayer to something we do as a last resort.

All we can do is pray.

All we can do?

Prayer is the MOST we can do. It is the best thing we can do. And it is a privilege that we get to.

The words in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 charge us to "Pray without ceasing."

At all times and with out end.

Prayer is not an isolated event. It's not a last resort, and it certainly isn't an empty act.

It's a posture of the heart. Every breath in our lungs, exhaled to the one who hears it all. And not only does he hear it all, he bears it all. He cares about it all. He wants it all.

Pray without ceasing. There's power in the persistence.
